Welcome to biTStream!
=====================

biTStream is a set of C headers allowing a simpler access to binary
structures such as specified by MPEG, DVB, IETF, etc.


biTStream vs. libdvbpsi
=======================

libdvbpsi converts binary structures to C structures. Lists are implemented
with chained lists of C structures.

biTStream is lower level, and more efficient: fewer memory allocations,
fewer memory copies. It also features a better separation between layers
and specifications.


Extending biTStream
===================

A lot of MPEG and DVB tables and descriptors are not implemented yet, or
are incomplete. Patches are very welcome.

Though biTStream is originally targeted at video applications in general
and MPEG-2 transport stream in particular, the same principle can be
followed with other binary data types, and patches are welcome here too.
Just try to follow a coherent directory naming.

My coding style is Linux kernel + Hungarian conventions. Really, I do not
care about the coding style of new files; do (WTF) you want. However, for
existing files, please try to follow the original conventions.

biTStream is released under the WTF public license because since it is a
direct application of standards, there is no added value. The WTF license
doesn't require you to contribute back your changes, and you can use
biTStream in proprietary applications. However, if you add new structures,
or fix bugs in current structures, you'd be very nice to contribute them
(again, there is no point in concealing this). Thanks.
